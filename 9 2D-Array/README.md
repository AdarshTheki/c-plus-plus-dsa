## 2D Array:

**The multidimensional Array is also known as Rectangular arrays in C++**. It can be two dimensional or three dimensional. The data is stored in tabular form (row âˆ— column) which is also known as matrix.

    int main(){
        Int arr[n][m];  //declaration of 2D array
        bool arr[n][m]; 
        char arr[n][m];
        float arr[n][m];
    }
