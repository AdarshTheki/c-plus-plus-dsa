## Types of Functions:

**There are two types of functions in C++ programming:**

**1. Library Functions:** are the functions which are declared in the C++ header files such as ceil(x), cos(x), exp(x), etc.

**2. User-defined functions:** are the functions which are created by the C++ programmer, so that he/she can use it many times. It reduces complexity of a big program and optimizes the code.

**Declaration of a function**

The syntax of creating function in C++ language is given below:

    return_type function_name(data_type parameter...)
    {
        //code to be executed
    }
