## Statements:

### Break and Continue Statement:

**Break statement stops the entire process of the loop. Continue statement only stops the current iteration of the loop.** Break also terminates the remaining iterations. Continue doesn't terminate the next iterations; it resumes with the successive iterations.

### Switch-Case Statement:

Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

    Syntax:
    switch(expression) {
        case x:
            // code block
            break;
        case y:
            // code block
            break;
        default:
            // code block
    }
