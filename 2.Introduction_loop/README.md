## 2 - Introduction of loops:

The C++ for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use **For, while & do-while loops.** The C++ for loop is same as C/C#. We can initialize variable, check condition and increment/decrement value.

**For loop:**

    Syntax:
    for(initialization expression; test expression; update expression){
            // statements to execute in the loop body
        }

**While Loop:**

    Syntax:
    while (test_expression){
        // statements to execute in the loop body
        update_expression;
    }

**Do While loop:**

    Syntax:
    do{
        // statements to execute in the loop body
        update_expression;
    }while(test_expression);
