## 1 - Data Type:

There are three data types in C++. which are **Primitive Data Types, Abstract Data Types, & Derived Data Types**. Primitive data types includes integer(int), floating-point(float), character(chr), boolean(bool), double floating-point(double float), valueless or void, and wide char().**Initialisation, Size of DataType, Input-Output.**

    int main(){
        int test;   // declaration
        test = 5;   // initialization
        cin>>n;     // Input
        cout<<n;    // Output (Display)
    }

## 2 - Introduction of loops:

The C++ for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use **for, while & do-while Loops.** The C++ for loop is same as C/C++. We can initialize variable, check condition and increment/decrement value.

**For loop:**

    Syntax:
    for(initialization expression; test expression; update expression){
            // statements to execute in the loop body
        }

**While Loop:**

    Syntax:
    while (test_expression){
        // statements to execute in the loop body
        update_expression;
    }

**Do While loop:**

    Syntax:
    do{
        // statements to execute in the loop body
        update_expression;
    }while(test_expression);

## 3 - Statements:

### Break and Continue Statement:

**Break statement stops the entire process of the loop. Continue statement only stops the current iteration of the loop.** Break also terminates the remaining iterations. Continue doesn't terminate the next iterations; it resumes with the successive iterations.

### Switch-Case Statement:

Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

    Syntax:
    switch(expression) {
        case x:
            // code block
            break;
        case y:
            // code block
            break;
        default:
            // code block
    }

## 4 - Star Pattern for Practice:

In any programming language, star patterns are one of the common patterns that are widely used because it helps to improve logical thinking and flow control knowledge. **To create pattern in the C++ language, you just have to use two loops or three loops.**

## 5 - Function:

To perform any task, we can create function. A function can be called many times. It provides modularity and code reusability.

###### Types of Functions:

**There are two types of functions in C++ programming:**

**1. Library Functions:** are the functions which are declared in the C++ header files such as ceil(x), cos(x), exp(x), etc.

**2. User-defined functions:** are the functions which are created by the C++ programmer, so that he/she can use it many times. It reduces complexity of a big program and optimizes the code.

**Declaration of a function**

The syntax of creating function in C++ language is given below:

    return_type function_name(data_type parameter...)
    {
        //code to be executed
    }

## 6 - Time Complexity:

**Time complexity** of any algorithm is the time taken by the algorithm to complete. It is an important metric to show the efficiency of the algorithm and for comparative analysis. We tend to reduce the time complexity of algorithm that makes it more effective.

**There are different types of time complexities used, let’s see one by one:**

1. Constant time – **O(1)**
2. Linear time – **O(n)**
3. Logarithmic time – **O(log n)**
4. Quadratic time – **O(n^2)**
5. Cubic time – **O(n^3)**

## 7 - Array:

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

To declare an array, define the variable type, specify the name of the array followed by square brackets and specify the number of elements it should store:

    int array[4] = {40,45,50,55};   // declaration
    int =  4 Bytes
    Array = 4 X 4 bytes = 16 bytes

## 8 - 2D Array:

**The multidimensional Array is also known as Rectangular Arrays in C++**. It can be two dimensional or three dimensional. The data is stored in tabular form (row ∗ column) which is also known as matrix.

    int main(){
        Int arr[n][m];  //declaration of 2D array
        bool arr[n][m];
        char arr[n][m];
        float arr[n][m];
    }

## 9 - Pointer (Important Topic):

**"Pointers are variables that store the address of other variables."** Getting started with the Pointers.Every variable is stored in the memory and each memory location has its own memory address. It enables us to pass variables by reference.

**'&' Operator:** It gives the address of the variable.

**'*' Operator:** It gives the value stored at the address, i.e dereferences the value stored at the address

    Example:
    void swap(int *a, int *b){
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
    }

## 10. STL-Strings:

**Character Array:**

- Need to know size beforehand.
- Larger size required for operation (concatenates or append).
- No terminating extra character.

**String:**

- Need to know size beforehand.
- Performing operation like concatenating and append is easier.
- Terminated with a special character ‘\0’.

**In-Build Function:-**

    getline(cin, s);        // input string
    s1.append(s2);          // insert s1+s2
    s.assign("Ribh");       // s = "Ribh"
    cout<<s.at(3)<< endl;   // particular position
    s.begin();              // first character
    s.end();                // last character
    s.clear();              // Erases all the contents
    s2.compare(s1)          // s2 - s1
    s.c_str();              // C-style string
    s.empty();              // string is empty
    s.erase();              // Deletes a substring
    s.find();               // Searches the string
    s.insert();             // Inserts additional characters
    s.length();             // Returns the length of the string
    s.size();               // Returns the length of the string
    s.resize();             // Resize the string to the new length
    s.substr(3, 4);         // copy of the string 3 to 4 is 3456
    stoi(s);                // strings convert to a integer
    to_string(s);           // convert integer to a string
    sort(s.begin(),s.end());                                // use sort() function
    transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::toupper);    //convert upper
    transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);    //convert lower
    sort(s.begin(), s.end(), greater<int>());               //sorting greater to lower
    sort(s.begin(), s.end(), greater<int>());               // 999887443 sort

## 13. Recursion:-

**Definition:** It is when a function all itself to make the problem smaller.

    Ex: To get the sum of the first 'n' number using recursion.
    int sum(int n){
        if(n==0){
            return 0;
        }
        int prevsum = sum(n-1);
        return n + prevsum;
    }

## 14. Permutation:

**A permutation,** also called an **“arrangement number”** or **“order”**, is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. A string of length n has **n!** permutation.

**Below are the permutations of string ABC.**

        “ABC”, “ACB”, “BAC”, “BCA”, “CBA”, “CAB”

## 15. Basic Concepts in Object-Oriented Programmings: (Oop's)

- **Classes -** Basic template for creating objects.
- **Objects –** Basic run-time entities.
- **Data Abstraction & Encapsulation –** Wrapping data and functions into a single unit.
- **Inheritance –** Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
- **Polymorphism –** Ability to take more than one forms.
- **Dynamic Binding –** Code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
- **Message Passing –** message (Information) call format.

#### Difference between Pop’s and Oop’s:

**Procedure Oriented Programming:**

- Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow.
- The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data.
- Functions can either use local or global data.
- Data moves openly from function to function.

**Object-Oriented Programming:**

- Works on the concept of classes and object.
- A class is a template to create objects.
- Treats data as a critical element.
- Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects.
